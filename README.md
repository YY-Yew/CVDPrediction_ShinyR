# CVDPrediction_ShinyR

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs also known as heart diseases) remain as the biggest cause for mortality rate throughout the world for past decades.

The world Health Organization (WHO) estimated 17.9 million people died from CVDs in 2016 which represents 31% of all global deaths.

The objective of this application is to provide doctors a platform to use existing dataset to predict the presence of cardiovascular diseases in patients based on selected attributes.

This application will provide advance verification and precaution for doctors, so that doctors may reduce the risk of misdiagnosing cardiovascular disease.

To implement machine learning in our application, we are using Cleveland heart disease dataset which we obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Below link is the prediction apps.
